Customer orders
Product details
Order dates
Transaction amounts
Data can be obtained from various sources, such as databases, CSV files, or other data storage systems.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is utilized to clean, filter, and transform the raw data into a format suitable for analysis. This process may involve:
Joining tables
Aggregating data
Handling missing values
Creating new calculated fields

3. Data Analysis
After data preparation, various SQL queries are written to perform in-depth data analysis, including:
Identifying top-selling pizza flavors
Analyzing sales trends over time
Evaluating customer demographics and preferences
Calculating average order values
Assessing the performance of individual restaurant locations

4. Power BI Visualization
   
Power BI is used to create interactive and informative visualizations showcasing the insights gained from the data analysis. Visualizations may include:
Bar charts and pie charts displaying sales by product category
Time series charts illustrating sales trends
Geographic maps showing the distribution of restaurant locations
Dashboards summarizing key performance indicators (KPIs)

5. Insights and Recommendations
   
Based on the analysis and visualizations, actionable insights and recommendations are provided to the pizza restaurant chain. These insights can help in making informed decisions to improve sales, marketing strategies, and overall business performance.
